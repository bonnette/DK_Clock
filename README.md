This is modification of code from an Instructable by TechKiwiGadgets https://www.instructables.com/id/Retro-Pac-Man-Clock/
The purpose of the modification is to adapt the design to work with a HiLetgo (ILI9486) 480X320 TFT display.<br/>(https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073R7Q8FF/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1).<br/>
And arduino Mega (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01H4ZLZLQ/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
Additionally, because the display is not a touch display. Code has been added to use physical buttons to allow the time to be set on the clock.
<br />
The above photo is the clock in a 3d printed case. The case can be found on Thingiverse.com.<br/>

There is a new version (V4) of the arduino code that makes Mario jump over the barrels. Mario also always goes up the ladder on level 4 in order to win the game.
